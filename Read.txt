this is a disk image, or rather the files for creating the image, 
namely kernel.asm and bootloader.asm .
 Well, that's it. To create a Vdi file, you need to enter the + command in CMD cd and the folder itself,
  or rather the path to it, and then after hastily entering the folder on CMD, 
  you need to write this code oh, I almost forgot,
   you also need to go after the img file meeting, you need to go to the qemu directory, 
   the directory is the same as navigating the path to CMD. if we insert the path to the installed qemu ,
    namely the folder , later we transfer the img file to qemu and there we already convert it to a VDI file, later after successful assembly - REM Build bootloader.asm
nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.bin

REM Build kernel.asm
nasm -f bin kernel.asm -o kernel.bin

REM Combining files into a single disk image
copy /b bootloader.bin + kernel.bin disk.img

REM Conversion to VDI using qemu-img
qemu-img convert -O vdi disk.img os.vdi

REM Running a disk image in QEMU
qemu
